# The-Gaming-Room

    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

 

The Gaming Room has approached Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) with the objective of developing a web-based version of their existing game, "Draw It or Lose It”. Software requirements include Database Integration, a Singleton Design Pattern, and a Stock Drawing Library. They want me to design a web-based game application with Cross-platform Compatibility, Multiplayer Interaction, and with Unique Name Management. 

 

 

    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 

 

I did well to complete all parts of the document early with detail in the summary and recommendations.  

 

 

    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 

 

The design document acted as a point of reference when designing the software. 

 

 

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

 

I would make the evaluation table nicer looking and easier to read. 

 

 

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

 

Understanding the user's needs allowed for the creation of a web-based multiplayer game that replicates the engaging experience of the existing Android app while supplying compatibility across various platforms. By prioritizing elements like unique team and game names, real-time interactions, and security measures, the software design aimed to create a solution that meets the client's goals and delivers an enjoyable gaming experience to the players. 

 

 

 

    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 

 

When approaching the design of software, I followed a systematic and user-centered approach to ensure that the final solution aligns with the client's requirements and user needs.
